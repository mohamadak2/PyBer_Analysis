# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview
The idea for this analysis is to create a summary table where we can view the following information on a "City Type" perspective:
- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare Per Ride
- Average Fare Per Driver

With this date we must explain how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results
We were able to obtain a summary of the "merged data" and consolidate the information on a "City Type" level:

You can see the following:
- Urban Areas had the most Total Rides
- Urban Areas had the most Total Drivers
- Urban Areas had the most Total Fares

This implies that the more riders and drivers availible may lead to a **lower fare price per ride and or lower fare price per driver**
The higher ride count & available drivers lead to higher fares collected

However, the Rural Area had the highest Average Fare Per Ride & Average Fare Per Driver.

Here is the graph that shows the total fares collected between 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28

As you can see the three city types are in there own classes when comparing total fare collected.

### Summary 

I would recommend to invest in expanding in more ubran expansion. This is where most of your money would be coming from.
Then use most of the money earned to invest in drivers in Suburban areas. This way you can start to pay drivers more in these area which will allow for more rides to occur.

Then maybe start charging a slightly higher fare in urban areas to earn even more income.
